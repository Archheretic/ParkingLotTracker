# ParkingLotTracker
This project is a proof of concept where we in conjunction with a raspberry pi with an attached pi camera use
camera recognition with OpenCV 3.2 to detect cars moving in and out of a parking lot. The goal

Links to other repositories which tie in with this project:


track how many free spots there is on a parking lot.
This project should be able to run on a Raspberry Pi or a similar product.



The way it is currently designed, it will only work if the camera is placed such that cars that travel upwards are
moving in to a parking lot and cars that are moving down are leaving the parking lot. These values are easily changed,
if these need to be reversed, but more heavy modifications would need to be made if the tracking would be horizontal
or diagonal as opposed to vertical.

To try this project for yourself, you have two options:

If you have a raspberry pi with an attached camera module a debian-based OS (alpine, raspbian jessie to name a few):
Compile OpenCV3.2 for python 2.7 yourself following the instructions found here: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/

Use pip to get packages for with NumPy, Request and PiCamera
pip install NumPy Request PiCamera

Clone our project and run CarTrackerStream.py with python 2.7 with the following command:
python CarTrackerStream.py

If you do not have a raspberry pi with an attached camera module but would like to test/develop in docker:

Due to time constraints, we do not have our own docker image available.
In the mean time you can use this image: https://hub.docker.com/r/rickryan/rpi-jessie-opencv3.2/

Install docker on your machine - https://www.docker.com/get-docker

Clone our project

Pull docker image with the following command:
docker pull rickryan/rpi-jessie-opencv3.2

Run the docker image with the following command:
docker run -ti -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
    -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` \
    rickryan/rpi-jessie-opencv3.2:latest

With the docker image running, navigate to where you cloned your project and enter the following command:
python CarTrackerVideo.py

This should run the program and display the video output generated by OpenCV to your screen.
